# TypeScript Type Error in Array Concatenation

This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when attempting to combine arrays of different types using the `concat` method. The type safety of TypeScript helps catch this error during development, preventing potential runtime issues.

The solution involves ensuring type consistency in the arrays being combined, which can be achieved through stricter type checking or array transformation.
